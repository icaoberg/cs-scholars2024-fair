The Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP) aims to create an immersive experience of a 3D-map representation of the human body, improving access to data of the human body and developing methods for tissue interrogation applicable to other research areas. To commence its first phase, HuBMAP achieved significant highlights, including standardizing protocols, innovating imaging and sequencing techniques, and establishing reliable data. These efforts led to the creation of high-resolution molecules and of the nine major organ systems. Researchers are working together to expand the map from a 2D to a 3D environment, including factors such as age and ethnicity.
Looking ahead, the main objective of HuBMAP is to provide freely accessible data via its online portal. The program focuses on investigating changes in individual cells and detecting diseases to prevent the harms of healthy aging. Understanding these details will help scientists develop better drugs targeting multiple organs and predict disease outcomes and progression more accurately in clinical settings. The HuBMAP production phase (2022â€“2026) has several goals. Additionally, it aims to generate reference datasets using new technologies, emphasizing building 3D maps and collecting data from diverse donors representing a range of demographic features (sex, race or ethnicity, and age). Its main purpose is to overcome challenges and gaps. Finally, it aims to improve metadata standards, analytical and visualization tools, and data integration and interpretation to enhance the tissue atlases of the human body through collaborative efforts.
